# Vivi Plot

The Plot module generates data ( from Model ) which is used by GNUPlot to generate plots, like Variation of energy consumed by nodes over simulation time, etc. Write a GNUPlot script that automatically generates plot as image files. Add multiple switches to GNUPlot script for flexible control by user.
